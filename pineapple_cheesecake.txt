Ingredients
2 packages (8 ounce size) cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 small can crushed pineapple
1 graham cracker pie crust

Directions
Open can of pineapple and let it drain in a strainer till completely dry. If not drained well it will cause cheesecake not to bake properly. If it is still a little moist when ready to use take an old dishtowel or a piece of old sheet (clean) and pour into sheet and twist it dry. 

Mix cream cheese, sugar and vanilla with a mixer on medium speed until well blended then add eggs and mix until blended. 

Now you will add the pineapple and stir in until well blended. 

Pour this mixture into pie crust and bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Refrigerate and enjoy, the next day is best!
